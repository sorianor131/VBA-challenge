Module 2 Homework Assignment - VBA Challenge

## Challenge
For this assignment we were instructed to create a script that would loop through all the stocks for one year and return the following information:
* Ticker symbol
* Yearly change of that ticker
* Percent change of that ticker
* Total volume of the stock.

In addition, our script should also return the stock with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume. 

## Source and References
The VBA code can be found in the "Stock Data Script" file. This script was developed and tested using the alphabetical_testing file and than copied over to the Multiple_year_stock_data file.
